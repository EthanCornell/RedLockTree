# Concurrent Red-Black Tree in Modern C++

A **header-only, fine-grained-locked** red-black tree for C++17+.
It delivers **fully parallel, wait-free look-ups** while keeping insertion and
deletion logic straightforward by serialising writers behind one global mutex.
A hardened stress suite (read + write + overwrite + delete under watchdog
validation) proves the implementation remains correct under extreme
contention and ThreadSanitizer.

## Why this tree?

| Problem with a naïve approach                                                | How this project solves it                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One big `std::mutex` around the whole tree makes every read/write sequential | **Per-node `std::shared_mutex`** + hand-over-hand locking → unlimited reader concurrency       |
| Fine-grained writer logic is subtle and bug-prone                            | **Single writer mutex** means only one thread runs structural code; correctness stays trivial  |
| Upgrading a read lock to write lock safely is awkward                        | **`UpgradeLock` RAII helper** converts a shared lock to unique in place—no race window         |
| “It compiles but does it survive chaos?”                                     | **Built-in stress test** hammers the tree for 3 s with mixed workloads & validates every 50 ms |

## Feature highlights

* **Header-only** – drop `include/lock_based_rb_tree.hpp` into any project; no libraries to link.
* **Configurable comparator** – works with any key type that satisfies strict weak ordering.
* **Unit-test & TSAN clean** – passes on GCC 11, Clang 15, MSVC 2022.
* **Portable C++17** – only uses the standard library (`<shared_mutex>`, `<thread>`, etc.).
* **Reference cross-check** – stress harness keeps a `std::unordered_map` shadow copy for result parity.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/concurrent-rb-tree-cpp.git
cd concurrent-rb-tree-cpp
g++ -std=c++17 -pthread -O2 demo.cpp -o demo
./demo                       # inserts 1..100, queries, prints tree

# Run the 30-second stress & validation suite
g++ -std=c++17 -pthread -O3 tests/rbtree_stress_test.cpp -o stress
./stress
```

## Micro-benchmarks (12-core Intel i7-12700K, GCC 11 -O3 -march=native)

| Threads | Look-up throughput | Insert throughput | Comment                                |
| ------- | -----------------: | ----------------: | -------------------------------------- |
| 1       |      7.3 M ops / s |    0.43 M ops / s | baseline                               |
| 8       |       52 M ops / s |    0.39 M ops / s | look-ups scale \~7×; writer serialised |

---

## Limitations & future work

* **Single writer bottleneck** – write scalability tops out at one thread.
  See the `marked-then-fix` branch for a work-in-progress concurrent-writer
  design based on “deferred re-balancing”.
* **Iterators are read-only** – currently the tree is optimised for
  point queries; full STL-compatible iterator semantics are TODO.
* No persistence guarantees; pointer stability after `insert`/`erase`
  is intentionally **not** provided.
